# Design

This document outlines the design principles and interface for the
`watrs` time tracker, as well as some differences from the original
Watson. This document is mainly a way to help keep me focused on what to
actually implement and when I will know what "done" looks like.

## Princples

My main aim is to build a simplified version of the
[Watson](https://github.com/jazzband/watson) time tracker. And I want to
follow a few principles to guide the design of it:

-   Empower the user to be familiar with their data by encouraging them
    to interact directly with the timesheet data, e.g. via the terminal
    or editor.
-   Save timesheet data in a format and structure that is human-readable
    and editable.
-   Structure timesheet data to be importable by different tools (for
    other analyses).
-   Assume Git will be used to keep backups.
-   Have a simple interface with a few actions.
-   Keep timesheet statistics to a minimal, instead referring to use
    other specialised tools for more advanced analyses.
-   Output statistics to the terminal in a table format (columns and
    rows).

## Interface

-   `start [<project>] [<tags>]`: Starts the timer for a given project
    with optional tags. Creates a new entry in the timesheet file with
    an empty `stop` field. If a timer is already running for a different
    project, it will stop the timer on the other project and start a new
    one for the given project. If no project is given, it defaults to
    starting the last project (along with the same tags used).

    It will not add a new entry if the timesheet file can't be
    parsed/read, if there are duplicate `id` values, or if there are
    `start` entries later than the `stop` entries.

-   `stop`: Stops the current timer. Adds a timestamp to the `stop`
    value in the timesheet file with an entry that has an empty `stop`
    value. It will only stop and add the timestamp if there is a timer
    running (the most recent `start` timestamp without a `stop`
    timestamp). Can't stop if the current `start` entry is in the future
    (e.g. if the person incorrectly edited the file).

    It has the same constraints as `start` for when it won't work.

-   `edit`: Opens the timesheet file in the user's editor (e.g. `vim`)
    for them to edit themselves. Use this to fix a mistake in an entry,
    remove an entry, fix a merge conflict, or cancel the currently
    running entry. Since this will "simply" open the file in the default
    editor, going to the necessary entry can be done by searching for
    the timestamp, project or tag, or going to the end of the file for
    the most recent entry.

    If you edit the file, it will only save if it passes the same
    constraints as the `start` command.

-   `stats [<subcommand>] [<options>]`: This command contains several
    subcommands that provide basic statistics for various aspects of the
    timesheet data.

    -   `projects`: Lists all projects with the total time spent for
        each project. Options include `--unit <unit>` to specify the
        unit of time to display (only units bigger than `day`, which is
        the default), `--number-of-units <n>` to show the `n` number of
        units the the statistics (e.g. `--number-of-units 3` to show the
        last 3 days), as well as `--include-tags` to include the time
        spent on each tag within each project, grouped by the unit.

    -   `tags`: Lists all tags with the total time spent for each tag.
        Options include the `--unit` and `--number-of-units` found in
        `projects`.

-   `today`: Mainly is a helper command to get an idea about the day.
    Lists the entries for the current day, including the entry that is
    currently running.

-   `WATRS_TIMESHEET_PATH`: Environment variable to set the location of
    the timesheet. If not set, it defaults to `~/.watrs/timesheet.json`.

## Data

Data is stored in a JSON file, found in the file provided by
`WATRS_TIMESHEET_PATH`. All entries have fields with keys for `id`,
`start`, `stop`, `project`, and `tags`. The `id` is a unique identifier
for the entry, generated using an UUID and is used to ensure an
identifiable entry for analyses. The `start` and `stop` fields are in
ISO 8601 format (stored in UTC timezone), which is a standard for
representing date and time (without microseconds). All fields can be
imported as strings.

While including both field keys and a character string for date will
make the file larger, it also makes it easier to read and edit. And
given that Polars will be reading from the file, size isn't really a
computational concern nor is it a concern for disk storage as most
modern computers have plenty of storage space. At the cost of a larger
file size, the benefit is a more human-readable and -editable structure.

The JSON structure looks a bit like this, *for each timesheet entry*:

``` json
{
  "id": "unique-id-12345",
  # Following the ISO 8601 format for date and time
  "start": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
  "stop": "2023-10-01T14:00:00Z",
  "project": "example_project",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

Since the data is structured as a JSON file with clear keys and all
strings, doing further analyses or wrangling on it is as easy as reading
it with [Polars](https://pola.rs) (or [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org)) via
Python, R, or the shell.

## Differences from Watson

### Data format

Watson stored it's data in a `[]` bracketed JSON file, with fields that
had values but no keys (they were unnamed). So that means if you wanted
to directly edit the file, you would have to know the order of the
fields. This is not very user-friendly, especially if you e.g. have a
merge conflict from using Git to track your timesheet. It also made it
much more difficult to read into other analysis tools.

### Commands

Some commands in Watson I almost never used or always misunderstood
their action/how to use them, often having to review the documentation
multiple time to (re)learn it (e.g. `report` vs `aggregate`). I decided
to drop or heavily modify/merge many commands:

-   Dropped: `restart`, `sync`, `help` (that's built into the Rust CLI),
    `merge`, `frames`, `add`
-   Merged/modified into `stats`: `report`, `aggregate`, `status`,
    `projects`, `tags`
-   Merged/modified into `edit`: `edit`, `cancel`, `remove`

### Options

Most Watson commands had several options or behaviours for each command
that I rarely used, nor liked. So I decided to:

-   Remove all "confirm new project/tags" options/behaviour, such as in
    `start` and `stop`.
